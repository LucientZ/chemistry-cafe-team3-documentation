# Course Appreciative Agreement

This is a living document. We agree that if there are any changes we need to make, we will discuss them as a class and make the changes we need.

1. Communication is critical for success: communicate early, often and honestly.

   2. Exchange at least two (2) different forms of effective communication with your team.  
   3. Respond to requests for information in a timely manner.  
   4. Do not deliberately leave teammates out of discussions or attempt to blame one teammate for the failure of another.

      1. Be respectful and open-minded to your teammates’ opinions and ideas.  
      2. Make an effort to listen to everyone.  
      3. Actively seek out diverse ideas  
   7. Communicate technical issues early with your group.  
   8. Document properly as many (all?) aspects of your contribution as possible, ideally as you are coding.  
2. Be responsible.  
   1. Complete your assigned tasks, take the initiative to find and complete tasks that need doing, and be clear with your teammates about what task(s) you are working on.   
   2. Don’t make last-minute changes unless the team agrees to make those change  
   3. Secure API keys (Don’t commit them to the repo)  
   4. Write test cases (Don’t merge broken code)  
   5. Learn how to merge branches properly. (Do not use \--force, don’t commit directly to main, don’t delete someone else’s merge code, etc.)  
   6. Avoid using GenAI for coding – the logic should be yours  
   7. See also: Communication  
3. Be accountable.
