# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: Chem Caf3

**Week**: 3/17

**Members**: Donato Curvino, Robbie Cook, James Fontenot, Kaili Fogle, Jackson Stewart

## Status Report

Over the past week, progress has been fairly stagnant. Probably a result of preparing for and then being in Spring Break. In addition, some of our members have gotten very sick and could not work on their parts of the project. However, we all have continued to work on the project in some capacity and have made some progress. We plan to finish up and combine what weâ€™ve worked on so far during this sprint in the coming days.
