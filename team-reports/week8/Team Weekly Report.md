## Status Report

For various reasons, team members are still working on the same tasks as last week and other members are waiting on these tasks to be completed. As a result, our team has not been very productive over this past week. However, we (except for Donato, who informed us he would be absent today) came together today to discuss new plans so that everyone has multiple tasks to work on throughout the week. We also plan to prepare our project for the upcoming evaluations.

On Tuesday, we had a meeting with Kyle where we showcased the state of the project after completing our last sprint. Kyle expressed satisfaction with our progress and helped us better align this sprint with the product Kyle expects out of us by the end of the project.
