## Current Status

### List the team’s accomplishments.

*Give yourselves a pat on the back!*

I, Donato, have been unavailable for most of this past sprint, so I haven’t been able to do a whole lot.

I, Kaili, have been doing what I can. I think that’s kinda neat.

### How is the team doing with communication?

* We’ve been pretty unresponsive in the team Discord, but otherwise fine.

###  How is the team doing with time? 

*Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?*

* We are currently behind schedule due to issues with integrating the frontend and backend together.

## Adjustments Going Forward

### Keep Doing

* We will continue to meet with Kyle on a semi-regular basis, communicate with each other through Discord, and reconvene as a full team (when possible) during class.
* We will continue to hold each other accountable.

### Start Doing

* Distributing work more evenly between members
* Integrating code sooner rather than at the last minute

### Stop Doing

* Being unresponsive on the Discord.
