# Team Retrospective Report

**Team**: Chem Caf3

**Retrospective Report Number**: 2

**Members**: Donato Curvino, James Fontenot, Robbie Cook, Jackson Stewart, Kaili Fogle

## Current Status

### List the team’s accomplishments.

*Give yourselves a pat on the back!*

* We met with Kyle and figured out the next steps we should take. We completed tasks such as accessibility features, improved authentication, began reworking elements of data design, creating configuration file exports, setting up nginx, and much more, all while fixing numerous bugs and issues.

### How is the team doing with communication?

* The team has continued to use Discord as the primary means of communication. We’ve grown accustomed to Discord and often found ourselves collaborating and discussing our thoughts on the project through the app. There’s always room for improvement, but we at the very least haven’t encountered any difficulties or frustrations regarding communication. We also established a rule to post PRs in the Discord, which has helped greatly.

###  How is the team doing with time?

*Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?*

* The project is slightly behind schedule, but we have been catching up faster recently. 
* Several of us had exams recently, so that has shifted our focus away from the project temporarily.
* Jackson is behind on database revisions (self-callout)
* Kaili has been lagging behind on some tasks (also self-callout)
* Donato has also been behind in general (another self-callout)

## Adjustments Going Forward

### Keep Doing
* We will continue to meet with Kyle and collaborate as a team to organize and complete tasks.

* Team distribution of work is good?

### Start Doing

* Ideally, we’d like for every member to complete tasks in a timely manner.

### Stop Doing

* We have still been waiting till the last minute for contributions, so we should stop procrastinating so much. (Especially with the project report.)
