# Team Retrospective Report

**Team**: Chem Caf3

**Retrospective Report Number**: 3

**Members**: Donato Curvino, James Fontenot, Robbie Cook, Jackson Stewart, Kaili Fogle

## Current Status

### List the team’s accomplishments.

* Corrected code coverage for the backend + simplified testing configuration
* re-implemented family editor
* added more accessibility features
* improved frontend UI modals
* user services fully use ORM

*Give yourselves a pat on the back!*

* I, Kaili, got my tasks in from the last sprint and this on time. Yay. I have conceived an idea most ingenious! I will do this again next sprint.
* My name is Robbie. And I, Robbie, declare on my honor that getting more than 3 hours of sleep shall end this festering, slothful dream!
* I am Donato, and I have actually found some time to code! Yippee!
* I, Jackson, also managed to find time to code!

### How is the team doing with communication?

* We still communicate pretty regularly on Discord. We manage to get each other’s pull requests in. Sometimes we take our time with communicating things, but we do make an active effort to inform each other of any developments or roadblocks.

###  How is the team doing with time? 

*Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?*

* I think the project is a little behind schedule. Some of us should probably pick up the pace next sprint to ensure that some major goals we had going into this project can be completed before the semester comes to a close.

## Adjustments Going Forward


### Keep Doing

* We will continue to meet with Kyle on a semi-regular basis, communicate with each other through Discord, and reconvene as a full team (when possible) during class.
* We will continue to hold each other accountable

### Start Doing

* Distributing work more evenly between members
* Integrating code sooner rather than at the last minute

### Stop Doing

* Waiting until Sunday to make pull requests!
* Failing to communicate
