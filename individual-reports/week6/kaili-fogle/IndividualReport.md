### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Though I said I was almost done with the backend reports last week, I noticed that there were some issues with how the testing and report generation worked and I've devoted a fair bit of time to trying to fix it. Mainly, I'm trying to figure out a way to get the report to generate into a simple, easily accessible file so that testing down the road can be really easy. However, the existing documentation for what I'm working with basically doesn't exist and I'm scratching my head over something that honestly isn't even that big of a deal. More importantly, I've been looking at improving backend tests and my suffering with the backend reports has been pretty useful in finding out some minor details, so I believe I can resolve that issue as well. I plan to keep reading the awful documentation and navigate my way through these issues throughout the course of this week.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
Spring Break definitely slowed things down, but that's to be expected. Once the full team is back up and running I think we'll get a lot of stuff done.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Team is as usual. Nothing notable to really report. Overall, our teamwork and dynamic is pretty solid.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
Aside from learning more about CodeCov, I've also been learning a lot about .NET testing features and particulars.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Robert is once again my pick. He's dedicated to the project, probably more than anyone else on the team, and is really supportive. We also talk about silly stuff in class so it's pretty fun having him around.


## Plans for Next Week
I want to finish both of these issues up, and then discuss new things to work on with Kyle and the team. However, chances are that I'll only get the two mentioned issues done. My apartment unit is currently going through renovations, so I'll have some phyiscal distractions throughout the week. Completely unrelated to the renovations, my apartment also has no internet access at the moment. They're working on switching internet providers for some reason, and so I've had no internet access at my apartment for the past few days. The estimate from the apartment for getting internet back up is "sometime this week."
