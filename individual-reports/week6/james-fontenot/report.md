### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Need faster build system; currently build takes nearly two minutes. 
Robert is planning to fix this by modifying the Dockerfile.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
Database migration is almost done; will probably have to deal with a lot of merge conflicts.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
It is functioning well, but I wish their was more communication between backend devs.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I learned how to write unit tests in .NET.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Robert, because he made our build much smaller.
