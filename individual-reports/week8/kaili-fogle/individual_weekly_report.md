See the project report.

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
After talking to Kyle, the team got a more clear vision for what needs to be done. But I wasn't able to find myself a task this week. I must admit, I probably could have found a task, but I ended up completing a lot of other work instead. I have plans now that don't require someone else to complete anything beforehand, so I'll be putting in double the work this week to pull my own weight.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
Progress was probably the slowest we've ever had. We've had a lot of people hop in and out of the project for personal reasons these past few weeks, but this week we're finally all back together, so I'd imagine things will be back up to speed this week.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team works well with each other. We're very relaxed but still fairly dedicated to the project. I don't think much needs to be said as its already been communicated in previous reports.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
Not much.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
I've been talking a fair bit with Robert and Jackson this week. Thanks to them, I have a better idea of the project's status, along with what I could be doing. They are great team members.

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*
A few things:
- I'm responsible for searching for bugs and making suggestions for better intuitiveness, accessibility, etc. for the application. I think this will be important since we will get other people who've never seen the latest version of the application to try it during evaluations.
- In the case that Jackson does get his migrations done, I'll be working with him to ensure verify that nothing completely breaks. May also need to write some backend tests.
- I'll then also need to make sure that the export configurations are properly working and correctly account for any new data additions we've made. This absolutely needs to be done before we hand the project back off to Kyle.
