*Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

- It has been difficult to break the changes into smaller chunks to commit iteratively, which has made the branch pretty messy and has made revision and review difficult. To fix this I am planning to use a freshly rebased branch and refactor "from scratch" using the existing branch as a reference, with an emphasis on breaking it up into more iterative chunks.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

- From my backend-focused perspective the project is behind our planned pace of improvements

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

- The rest of the team is functioning well, I've unfortunately still been a bit of a hindrance

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

- I now understand better how Entity Framework works with the database and have some experience developing with it

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

- Robbie continues to be the hardest working member of the team

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

- I will be cleaning up and finishing database changes
- I want to begin working on pseudo-version-control functionality to be working by the end of the development cycle
