### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
I could not log-in on the front-end. 
I solved the problem by updating my environment file. 
I also need a new open issue to work on. 
I will ask the sponsor about new issues.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
The project is moving well; we have only three relevant open-issues.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
It is functioning well, but I should probably take on more work.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I learned more about environment files.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Donato, because he finished the engineering systems section of project report.


## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

I will look into either working on a front-end issue or new back-end issue from the sponsor.
