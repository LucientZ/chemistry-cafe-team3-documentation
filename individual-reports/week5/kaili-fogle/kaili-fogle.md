## Current Status

### What did _you_ work on this past week?

| Task | Status | Time Spent |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- |
|  .YAML Configuration Export | Completed | 2 hrs |
| Backend Codecov Report Generation | Almost Done | 5 hrs |

*Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
I didn’t have any issues with the .YAML export. However, I encountered a lot of weird issues on my machine when working on the codecov issue. Ultimately, I managed to resolve the issue and believe I am in the final stages of completing the task. Other than that, I had no problems whatsoever with the project and my team.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?
It’s clear that we’ve slowed down a fair bit, mainly because a few of us like to find ways to procrastinate (or be me and really suck at time management). However, we’re overall satisfied with what’s been completed so far.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
I really like my team. I find them easy to work with and talk to. We often work together or discuss issues with one another in our Discord chat. I think our team dynamic is overall one of our best strengths.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I learned a lot about codecov and github actions and workflows. In my past projects, these were either already done or someone else in my team handled them, so I guess now’s my turn to learn them. I also learned a lot more about how our project’s tests are written, or just how testing overall is done in .NET.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
I think Robert was my most awesome team member this week as well. We just get along and he’s always kind and helpful with everyone.


## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*
I plan to finish the backend code coverage report stuff. I already managed to generate the right files needed for lcov, now I just have to rework the existing workflow to run and regenerate the files before sending the result to our project’s lcov page. Aside from that, I honestly don’t really know. I’ll have to check-in with Kyle and/or my team members to figure out what I can start doing. Once Jackson finishes the data design changes though, it’s very likely that I’ll need to slightly tweak my .JSON and .YAML exports again, but this hardly counts as a new task.
