### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Information redundancy is a big issue, but as long as data is kept consistent
at API calls I should avoid any bugs.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
The project is progressing well; need to compress a lot of code.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is functioning well; could have more communication between back-end and front-end devs.

I learned a lot about GUID and OAuth.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Robert because he has done really good job acting as team coordinator.
