The database did not migrate in producetion. We plan on automating database migrations in the future to mitigate this issue.


### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

The project has caught up to what I expected for the most part. There's still some things to desire, but I like where we're at.

Our team is functioning better than it has ever been. I feel like we're finally fitting into our roles.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I had to actually learn Material UI and it's pretty intuitive. Everything styles pretty well and it has support for custom css in those edge cases where you need just a little bit of padding.

My most awesome team member this weak was Donato with the frontend deployment. 

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

This week, I plan on reimplementing the interface for editing families. It is a little unintuitive both to modify and to use with its multiple scrollbars.
